# TEKKENSOURCE

A TEKKEN 8 frame data webapp.

## Characters
Characters have a small description of their general playstyle utilizing keywords under their name in their character pages.

## Frame Data
Information for the frame data table is being fetched from a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IDC11ShZjpo6p5k8kV24T-jumjY27oQZlwvKr_lb4iM/edit?gid=1132769394#gid=1132769394">Google Sheets<a> page and displayed on a table for every TEKKEN 8 character.

## Search
The search bar on the frame data table lets you find moves you want easily. Currently, it supports multiple functionalities:
Search by move input
Search by move name
Search by move startup
Search by move block frames

## Frame Data Table
Block frames are color coded. Moves that are + on block are colored in blue, moves that are -10 or higher are colored in a light red, and moves that are at least -15 have a darker red color, to indicate that they are launch punishable by most of the cast.

## Character Punishment
Punish moves for a character can be found here. An information icon is displayed for punishes that have notes. A (+) next to the damage value of a punish indicated a combo potential for more damage.

## Character Resources
